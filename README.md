# 🖼️ Image Processing with OpenCV

A beginner-friendly project for exploring various **image processing techniques** using OpenCV and Python.

## 🔹 Features
✅ Load and display images  
✅ Face detection using Haar Cascade  
✅ Contour detection  
 

## Different Image Processing Techniques
```txt
Grayscale Conversion 
Blurring - Reduces noise and smoothens images.
Thresholding - Converts images into binary form.
Morphological Transformations - Enhances object shapes.
Adaptive Thresholding - Works better in different lighting conditions.
Histogram Equalization - Improves contrast.
Sobel & Laplacian Edge Detection - Detects gradients and object boundaries.
```

## 🛠 Setup Instructions:
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Siddhesh-04/CodeClauseInternship_Image-Recognition-with-OpenCV.git
```
2️⃣ Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Then, install required packages:
```txt
opencv-python
numpy
matplotlib
```
3️⃣ Run the Notebook:
```txt
Launch Jupyter Notebook and open main.ipynb:
Run cell to see face detection and contour detection in action.
Note: Change your Image Path
```
